* This is **a job application assistant application for NUS fresh graduates who are looking for jobs**
* We offer fresh graduates an efficient Contact Book app for job hunting. It simplifies contact management, provides reminders and enhances organisation, helping users stay competitive in the job market.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _JobFindr_) used for managing job applications.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[JobFindr Product Website](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
