# Project: JobFindr

This portfolio provides an overview of my contributions to JobFindr.

## Overview

JobFindr is a desktop-based job application management application.

The inspiration for JobFindr came from the shared challenge faced by all members of our team - the daunting task of
organising and keeping track of the numerous job applications we submit. Recognising that this is a common experience
among NUS students, we felt a strong urge to develop a software solution that would make this process more manageable
for students like us.

JobFindr was born out of this necessity, offering a one-stop solution for recording and managing your job applications
effortlessly.

## Summary of Contributions

### Enhancements
1. Added `status` field
  * **What it does**: Added `status` field for Job objects so that users can indicate whether the application is `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.
  * **Justification**: Users should be able to add the status so that they can better track and decide on the next course of action of the applications.
  * **Highlights**: Relevant classes such as Status class had to be added and relevant test cases such as StatusTest had to be implemented.
