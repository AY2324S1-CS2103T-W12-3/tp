# Project: JobFindr

This portfolio provides an overview of my contributions to JobFindr.

## Overview

JobFindr is a desktop-based job application management application.

The inspiration for JobFindr came from the shared challenge faced by all members of our team

- the daunting task of organising and keeping track of the numerous job applications we submit. Recognising that this is
  a common experience among NUS students, we felt a strong urge to develop a software solution that would make this
  process more manageable for students like us.

JobFindr was born out of this necessity, offering a one-stop solution for recording and managing your job applications
effortlessly.
