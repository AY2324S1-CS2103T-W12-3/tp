## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* NUS fresh graduates who are looking for jobs 
* Has a need to manage a significant number of job applications 
* Prefers desktop apps over other types 
* Able to type fast 
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Manage job applications faster than a typical mouse/GUI-driven app.

### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `***`, Medium (nice to have) - `**`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

| Priority | As a … | I want to …                                                                       | So that I can…                                   |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `***`    | user   | add applications I have applied to, including their names and contact information | keep track and manage my job applications        |
| `***`    | user   | record application deadlines for each job listing                                 | stay organized on application deadlines          |
| `***`    | user   | mark the status of each application                                               | keep track of application progress               |

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
2. A user with above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse. 
3. The system should respond to the user’s command within two seconds. 
4. The user interface should be intuitive enough for users who are first-time users. 
5. The project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a milestone set every two weeks.
