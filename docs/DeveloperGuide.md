### Architecture

### UI Component

**API:**
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/ui/Ui.java)

**Description:**

The `UI` component is responsible for managing the user interface of the application so that it can respond according to
the user's actions or commands entered.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view folder`. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

**Functionality:**

The UI component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the UI relies on the Logic to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays Person object residing in the Model.

**Component Structure:**

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="900" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts like `CommandBox` and `ResultDisplay`.
These parts are always being shown in `MainWindow`, while other parts like `JobListPanel`, `JobDetailsPanel` are only
visible
to the user depending on the state of the application e.g. when the job list if not empty, when a job is selected.

etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities
between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Command

The add command allows the user to add job applications with various attributes.

Compulsory attributes are `Company` and `Role`.

Optional attributes are `Status`, `Industry`, `Deadline` and `JobType`

#### Implementation

It is implemented by `AddCommand` and `AddCommandParser`.

`AddCommandParser` parses the users' input and checks for the presence of compulsory and optional prefixes.
The information is then used to create a new Job Application through the `AddCommand`.

(insert UML diagram here)

The following sequence/activity diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the AddCommand:

(insert UML diagram here)

#### Design Considerations

---

### Edit Command

The edit command allows the user to edit any field in their job application.

#### Implementation

It is implemented by `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`.

`EditCommandParser` parses the users' input and checks for the valid prefixes to determine the field the user wants to
change.
The information is then used to create a new Job Application with the updated fields while retaining the unchanged
fields through the `EditCommand`.

The following Class Diagram of EditCommand illustrates the interactions between EditCommand and other classes:

(insert UML diagram here)

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the EditCommand:

#### Design Considerations

---

### Delete Command

The delete command allows the user to delete a job application using its index.

#### Implementation

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the command:

(insert UML sequence diagram)

The `DeleteCommand` class implements this command. It accepts an index and deletes the job application at the specified
index.

The `DeleteCommandParser` class is used to parse the arguments for the command from the user input. If the user input
does not conform to the expected format e.g. the index is out of bounds, a `ParseException` is thrown. If the user input is
valid,
then `DeleteCommandParser` returns the corresponding `DeleteCommand`.

#### Design considerations

---

### List Command

The list command allows the user to view the list of all job applications.

#### Implementation

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the command:

(insert UML diagram here)

The `ListCommand` class implements this command. It sets the predicate for the `filteredList` of `Model` to
`PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_JOBS` which evaluates any `Job` to true.

#### Design Considerations

---

### Sort Command

The sort command allows the user to sort the current list of job applications based on a specified field.

#### Implementation

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the command:

(insert UML sequence diagram)

The `SortCommand` class implements this command. It accepts a `FieldComparator` which will be set as the comparator when
`Model::sortJobs` is called.

The `SortCommandParser` class is used to parse the arguments for the command from the user input. If the user input does
not conform to the expected format, a `ParseException` is thrown. If the user input is valid, then `SortCommandParser`
generates the corresponding `FieldComparator` which will be set as the comparator when sorting the list.

The overriding `FieldComparator::compare` method compares the field indicated by the specifier. To achieve this, the
relevant field method must be invoked.

* For alphabetically sorted fields (`Company`, `Role`, `Status`, `Industry`, `JobType`), `String::compareToIgnoreCase`
  is used.
* For chronologically sorted fields (`Deadline`), a custom `compareTo()` method is implemented.

#### Design considerations

---

### Find Command

The find command allows the user to get a filtered list of job applications.

#### Implementation

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the command:

(insert UML sequence diagram)

The `FindCommand` class implements this command.
It accepts a `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` which will be set as the predicate when `Model::updateFilteredJobList` is
called.

The `FindCommandParser` class is used to parse the arguments for the command from the user input. If the user input does
not conform to the expected format, a `ParseException` is thrown. If the user input is valid, then `FindCommandParser`
generates the corresponding `FindCommand` with a `FieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` which will be set as the predicate
when filtering through the list.

#### Design considerations

---

### Clear Command

The clear command allows the user to delete all job applications.

#### Implementation

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of invocation for the command:

(insert UML sequence diagram)

The `ClearCommand` class implements this command.

#### Design considerations

---
## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* NUS fresh graduates who are looking for jobs
* Has a need to manage a significant number of job applications
* Prefers desktop apps over other types
* Able to type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Manage job applications faster than a typical mouse/GUI-driven app.

## **Appendix C: Effort**

Explain the difficulty level, challenges faced, effort required, and achievements of the project.

## **Appendix D: Planned Enhancements**

listing fixes you propose to add in the near future, to counter known feature flaws.
This section may contain up to team_size x 2 enhancements e.g., a 5-person team can have up to 10 enhancements.
Each enhancement should be specific, describing the feature flaw it addresses and how exactly the feature will be changed, providing sample UIs/inputs/outputs if applicable. e.g.,
The current error message for a failed contact deletion Operation failed! is too general. We plan to make the error message also mention which action failed and the reason for the failure: The contact Amy Lee could not be deleted as it is referenced by another contact Ben Chua.
Each enhancement should be a tweak to an existing feature, and should not be a new feature altogether.
type.FeatureFlaw bug reports matching an item in this section will not be penalized for the team, and testers will not earn credit for reporting them either. However, testers can report type.FeatureFlaw bugs on the enhancements listed in this section, if they think the planned feature tweak itself is flawed/inadequate.
