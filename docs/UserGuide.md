JobFindr is a **Contact Book app** for NUS fresh graduates who are looking for jobs.

It simplifies _contact management_, provides _reminders_ and enhances _organisation_, helping users _stay competitive_
in the job market.
The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _JobFindr_) used for managing job
applications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `jobfindr.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.
4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and enter the command `java -jar jobfindr.jar`
   to run the application.
5. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data.<br><br>

### Command format

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.


* Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
    * e.g. in `add c/COMPANY`, `COMPANY` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/Google`.


* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    * e.g. `c/COMPANY [s/STATUS]` can be used as `c/Google s/Pending` or as `c/Google`.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    * e.g. if the command specifies `c/COMPANY r/ROLE`, `r/ROLE c/COMPANY` is also acceptable.
    * When `INDEX` is required, it has to be the first parameter.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
    * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The same prefix cannot be used multiple times in the same command. 
  * e.g. `add r/Cleaner c/Google c/Microsoft` is an invalid input. 


* `INDEX` refers to the index number of the chosen application in the displayed application list and must be a _positive
  integer_ 1, 2, 3, â€¦
