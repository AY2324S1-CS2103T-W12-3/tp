### Command format

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Words in upper case are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
    * e.g. in `add c/COMPANY`, `COMPANY` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/Google`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    * e.g. `c/COMPANY [s/STATUS]` can be used as `c/Google s/Pending` or as `c/Google`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    * e.g. if the command specifies `c/COMPANY r/ROLE`, `r/ROLE c/COMPANY` is also acceptable.
    * When `INDEX` is required, it has to be the first parameter.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
    * e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* A _white space_ must be included directly before each [prefix](#prefix).

* The same prefix cannot be used multiple times in the same command.
    * e.g. `add r/Cleaner c/Google c/Microsoft` is an invalid input.

* `INDEX` and `JOB_INDEX` refers to the index number of the chosen application in the displayed application list and
  must be a _positive
  integer_ 1, 2, 3, …
